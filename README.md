## How to start

### Creating a town

1. Create a custom banner and make some copies, you will need them later.
2. Rename the banner with the name you want to give to your town.
3. Place the banner where you want to found it. It will create the town and claim the chunk the banner was placed in.
4. Now you can manage your town through the lectern that just appeared.

### Claiming land

1. Rename one of the banners you copied earlier to the name of the town.
2. Make sure you have enough power to claim (each server may require a different amount). Power is earned through killing mobs.
3. Place the banner on the land you want to claim. Keep in mind it has to be adjacent to land you already own.

### Creating a town role
1. Rename a paper with the name of the role
2. Right click the town lectern with it
3. Use the lectern's role menu to edit its permissions
4. Assign it to a resident through the lectern's resident menu

### Moving the town's lectern
1. Rename a lectern with the town's name
2. Place it where you want it to be. The previous one will be removed.

## Extra information
- You can see claimed land using maps
- If you have a compass on your inventory you will be notified when entering/exiting a town's territory, and you will be able to see nearby borders if you have it on your main hand
